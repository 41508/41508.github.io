# Upside and Downside of Having A Cat
## Pros
- You have a companion as long as the cat lives.
- You'll have a very peaceful morning because most cats are asleep during the day.
- A cat's purring can reduce anxiety.
- They are independent as well as low maintenance.
- Cats make great apartment pets.
## Cons
- Cats can't pay rent and can't afford any of their own needs.
- Get ready for them running and pushing things off counters and tables at 12 am.
- Your pet may bite or scratch you when you try to pet it.
- They act like you're living in THEIR house.
- Cats are extremely lazy and most are hydrophobic so good luck giving them a bath.

# More Feeling!!!
Cats are very expressive. You can tell what your pet is feeling just through body langauge. The following are some examples:

> If you taught the adults were enough of a handful, wait till you have kittens running around, meowing in the middle of the night 😄👍

There's just no dull moment with them, huh? 〒▽〒 But, that's the fun in owning cats or any other pet really. We as their owners should always take the time out of our day to clean them when they got dirty, teach them tricks, play and accompany them, as well as shower them with lots of treats 😋 and love 🥰.
